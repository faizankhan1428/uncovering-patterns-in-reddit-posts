# Uncovering Patterns in Reddit Posts using NLP and Machine Learning

This project analyzes Reddit posts from the r/Conspiracy subreddit to uncover patterns in language and sentiment. Using a combination of NLP preprocessing, topic modeling, and machine learning classification, we explore how conspiracy-style text differs from typical Reddit content.

## 📌 Key Features

- Text preprocessing with `text2vec` and TF-IDF
- Sentiment analysis of post bodies
- Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Logistic regression classifier for conspiracy detection
- Basic evaluation with accuracy score

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- R (data manipulation, modeling, and visualization)
- tidyverse, text2vec, topicmodels, glmnet

## 📁 Dataset

Public dataset sourced from Kaggle:
[Reddit Conspiracy Posts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrisdal/reddit-top-2-5-million)

## 🚀 Future Work

- Improve classification with deep learning or contextual embeddings
- Include metadata (user info, timestamps)
- Apply network analysis on comment threads
